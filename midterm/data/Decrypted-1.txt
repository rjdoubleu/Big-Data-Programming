niklaus wirth on the cdc  around  as an instructional tool for elementary programming this language designed primarily to keep students from shooting themselves in the foot and thus extremely restrictive from a generalpurposeprogramming point of view was later promoted as a generalpurpose tool and in fact became the ancestor of a large family of languages including modula and ada see also bondageanddiscipline language the hackish point of view on pascal was probably best summed up by a devastating and in its deadpan way screamingly funny  paper by brian kernighan of kr fame entitled why pascal is not my favorite programming language which was turned down by the technical journals but circulated widely via photocopies it was eventually published in comparing and assessing programming languages edited by alan feuer and narain gehani prenticehall  part of his discussion is worth repeating here because its criticisms are still apposite to pascal itself after ten years of improvement and could also stand as an indictment of many other bondageanddiscipline languages at the end of a summary of the case against pascal kernighan wrote  there is no escape this last point is perhaps the most important the language is inadequate but circumscribed because there is no way to escape its limitations there are no casts to disable the typechecking when necessary there is no way to replace the defective runtime environment with a sensible one unless one controls the compiler that defines the standard procedures the language is closed people who use pascal for serious programming fall into a fatal trap because the language is impotent it must be extended but each group extends pascal in its own direction to make it look like whatever language they really want extensions for separate compilation fortranlike common string data types internal static variables initialization octal numbers bit operators etc all add to the utility of the language for one group but destroy its portability to others i feel that it is a mistake to use pascal for anything much beyond its original target in its pure form pascal is a toy language suitable for teaching but not for real programming pascal has since been almost entirely displaced by c from the niches it had acquired in serious applications and systems programming but retains some popularity as a hobbyist language

work and may or may not eventually be incorporated permanently into the program distinguished from a diff or mod by the fact that a patch is generated by more primitive means than the rest of the program the classical examples are instructions modified by using the front panel switches and changes made directly to the binary executable of a program originally written in an hll compare oneline fix  vt to insert a patch into a piece of code  in the unix world n a diff sense   a set of modifications to binaries to be applied by a patching program ibm operating systems often receive updates to

cant  or dont  inspect and examine before installing they couldnt find any trap doors or any way to penetrate security of ibms os so they made a site visit to an ibm office remember these were official military types who were purportedly on official business swiped some ibm stationery and created a fake patch the patch was actually the trapdoor they needed the patch was distributed at about

of a data set that is grossly atypical of normal expected input esp one that exposes a weakness or bug in whatever algorithm one is using an algorithm that can be broken by pathological inputs may still be useful if such inputs are very unlikely to occur in practice  when used of test input implies that it was purposefully engineered as a worst case the implication in both senses is that the data is spectacularly illconditioned or that someone had to explicitly set out to break the algorithm in order to come up with such a crazy example  also said of an unlikely collection of circumstances if the network is down and comes up halfway through the execution of that command by root the system may just crash yes but thats a pathological case often used to dismiss the case from

channel open in mumble mode having the foo switch set and on the phase of the moon see also heisenbug true story once upon a time there was a program bug that really did depend on the phase of the moon there was a little subroutine that had traditionally been used in various programs at mit to calculate an approximation to the moons true phase gls incorporated this routine into a lisp program that when it wrote out a file would print a timestamp line almost  characters long very occasionally the first line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the next line and when the file was later read back in the program would barf the length of the first line depended on both the precise date and time and the length of the phase specification when the timestamp was printed and so the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon the first paper edition of the jargon file steele included an example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug but the typesetter corrected it this has since been described as the phaseofthemoonbug bug however beware of assumptions a few years ago engineers of cern european center for nuclear research were baffled by some errors in experiments conducted with the lep particle accelerator as the formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers before being seen by humans many people suggested the software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon a few desperate engineers discovered the truth the error turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the geometry of the km

through such media as the legendary tap newsletter this ethos began to break down in the mids as wider dissemination of the techniques put them in the hands of less responsible phreaks around the same time changes in the phone network made oldstyle technical ingenuity less effective as a way of hacking it so phreaking came to depend more on overtly criminal acts such as stealing phonecard numbers
