times of peace are of everyday occurrence between contending armies amongst those i had occasion to call on at st louis was a major  he had formerly been engaged in indian warfare and having received a wound from a rifleball that incapacitated him for active military duty he was living as a retired citizenhis wifes jointure and an allowance from government allowing him to keep up a tolerably good establishment he was the owner of several slaves and amongst the rest a young woman who was employed as nursemaid in the family the first time i called at his residence i thought him a man of superior manners and education and was much pleased with the visit which was concluded with a promise to renew it on a future day when however i repeated my visit soon after i found him alone in his study and his constrained manner soon led me to perceive that something unusual perturbed his mind the cause was soon after explained for the negress before mentioned coming into the room on some trifling errand to my surprise accosted him rather freely her master suddenly broke out in a paroxysm of rage swore at her awfully and accused her in a ruffianly way of being insolent to her mistress then violently ringing a bell which stood on the table he summoned a negro lad into the room and at once despatched him to a neighbours house to borrow a new rawhide whip threatening all the while to flay her alive in vain the terrified creature pleaded innocence he would take no excuse and although i begged earnestly for him to pass over the offence and the poor slave fell on her knees in the greatest terror he vowed vengeance with dreadful imprecations at last the whip came and disregarding alike the presence of a stranger and the entreaties of a woman he began the flagellation with murderous earnest my interference only added to his ungovernable rage the rawhide was new and the major being a strong muscular man every stroke told the blood soon flowed from the back neck and breasts of the poor victim whose cries as she writhed under the savage infliction entered my soul they however made no impression on her brutal tormentor who kept vociferating with all his energy to keep her quiet it was with some difficulty i stood by and witnessed the assault but i well know my life would be in jeopardy if i attempted to interfere i however screwed up my courage to stay in the hope that some sense of shame might induce the fellow to hold his hand this was however a delusive hope for he continued to lay on the whip until he was exhausted the girl was now on the floor of the room moaning piteously and a stream of blood was flowing from her lacerated person which soaked the matting that covered the floor her dress was hanging in tatters and the blood trickling down her cheeks had a horrifying effect as soon as the ruffian was tired he bid the woman get down stairs and wash herself the miserable creature arose with difficulty and picking up her apron and turban which were in different parts of the room she hobbled out crying bitterly as soon as she was gone the major pointed to the blood and said if we did not see that sometimes there would be no living with the brutes to which i replied in terms he could not misunderstand and at once left the house determined never again to enter ita resolution i religiously kept i afterwards heard that this miserable creature was pregnant at the time a circumstance that would have induced at least some regard to leniency in any man not utterly debased those who are acquainted with southern scenes will see nothing extraordinary in this recital for they are everyday occurrences and scarcely elicit a remark unless the perpetrator should happen to be a slaveholding wesleyan or whitfieldite when perhaps he would be called to some accounthis own version of the affair being of course admitted in limine many of the slaveholders are an incorrigibly degraded set of men it is by no means uncommon for them to inflict chastisement on negresses with whom they are in habitual illicit intercourse and i was credibly informed that this cruelty was often resorted to to disabuse the mind of a deceived and injured wife who suspects unfair treatment this attested fact disgraceful as it is can scarcely be wondered at in men who mercilessly subject defenceless women to the lash without a spark of human feeling or compunction of conscience it is little to the credit of united states senators that they have not at least made laws to protect women from the barbarous usage of flogging one would imagine that men who perhaps above all others in the world pay homage to the sex would have established a distinction in this respect but i apprehend the truth to be that they are so far influenced by their wives who are notoriously jealous of their sable rivals that they have succumbed to their sentiments and dictation there are many dutch in st louis and along the levee you perceive boardinghouses and groceries kept for their accommodation these men are generally great drinkers and think as little of quaffing at a few draughts halfapint of whiskey as an englishman would the same quantity of malt liquor they consume also vast quantities of claret i have frequently seen a couple of these men at a cafe drink five or bottles without betraying any ill effects it must however be remembered that claret is not so potent as the heavier wines a few days after my arrival while standing in the vestibule of my hotel my attention was drawn to a loud altercation going on at the bar and as it was evident from the manner of the parties that some public question was being discussed i listened and ascertained that an obnoxious citizen had been seized for perpetrating a petty act of revenge on a neighbour by damaging his horse and was that day to be publicly tarred feathered and escorted out of the city as they said bag and baggage having ascertained the spot selected for the scene i determined to witness it accordingly at noon the appointed hour i repaired to an open spot of buildingland on the carondelet side of the city here i found assembled a motley assemblage of citizens negroes steamboathands and the general riffraff of the place although the crowd was not so great the meeting strongly reminded me of those scenes of infamy and disgrace in englandpublic executions the conduct of the assembled throng on this occasion being the more decorous of the two precisely at twelve the mob made a rush towards one corner of the open space from which direction i saw the culprit advancing in charge of thirty or forty welldressed people the committee appointed for the occasion being among the number he was a stout man and described to me as a great bully but now he looked completely crestfallen as the party came on he was hissed by the mob who however kept at a good distance from his guard a man with a large tin can of smoking pitch a brush of the kind used in applying the same and a pillow of feathers under his arm followed immediately behind the prisoner vociferating loudly arrived at the spot the poor wretch was placed on a stool and a citizen who had taken a very prominent part in front of the procession and who i was told was the chief cause of this outrage stepped in front of him and pulling out a sheet of paper read a lecture on the enormity of his crime which wound up with the sentence about to be enforced when this was finished the man who carried the tarvessel stepped up and began with a scissors to cut off the culprits hair which he did most effectually flinging portions amongst the crowd who scrambled after them as soon as this was finished and the man was stripped to the waist the brush was dipped into the pitch and the upper part of his person lathered therewith not a word escaped him but the individual who had taken so prominent a part in the punishment kept giving directions to the operator to put it on thick even his eyes and ears were not spared as soon as this part of the operation was complete the bag of feathers was ripped open by a bystander and the contents stuck thickly on the parts besmeared with tar amidst the deafening cheers of the spectators who were by this time in such frantic excitement that i began to fear a tragedy would ensue especially as many of them shouted now hang the varmint hang him this proposal was eagerly seconded by the mob this was however resolutely overruled by his keepers the appearance presented by the victim in this peculiarly american dress was ludicrous in the extreme and looked very comfortable as soon as this part of the exhibition was finished a man with a small drum followed by the mob with yells and execrations drove the culprit before them at a run the poor wretch ran like a deer from his pursuers who followed at his heels shouting frantically until he reached the brink of the river where a boat was waiting to take him off he dashed into it and was at once rowed into the middle of the stream out of reach of his tormentors who i quite believe would have administered more severe lynchlaw if they could have got hold of him for their passions were wrought up to the highest pitch of excitement one feature in the scene i could not help remarkingthe negroes all appeared in high glee and many of them actually danced with joy i did not wonder at this for the negroes always seemed to exult if a white man was in disgrace which after all is no more than might be expected from a class of men tyrannized over as the coloured people are there and is one of the results of the oppressive system that exacts everything that human labour can furnish without remuneration and without in by far the greater number of instances any approach to sympathy or grateful feeling this alone without taking into consideration the outrages inflicted on the race by their cruel oppressors supplies a sufficient cause for such a tendency if every other were wanting passing through the principal street the day before i left st louis an assembly of men chiefly overseers and negro dealers who stood at the entrance of a large store attracted my attention large placards with a description of various lots of negroes to be submitted to public competition soon told me i should now be able to gratify my curiosity by witnessing a missouri slavevendue a man with a bell which he rang most energetically at the door shortly after summoned the company the auction being about to commence on a table inside a negress of a little over middle age was standing vacantly gazing with griefworn countenance on the crowd that now thronged to the table on the floor stood two children of about the ages of ten and thirteen respectively the auctioneer with the customary volubility of such men in america began by stating that the lots now to be offered were the remnants of a preceding sale which he gratuitously observed had been a most satisfactory one and after dilating with some energy on the good qualities of the woman before us whose face brightened up a little on hearing such a flattering account of her good qualities he earnestly requested a bidding the poor creature was evidently in illhealth after the most revolting questions had been put to her and her person examined by the competitors with disgraceful familiarity she was pronounced all but worthless used up as one of the company observed and was after much demur on the part of the auctioneer knocked down for two hundred dollars this sum being as he remarked but the moiety of what she ought to have realized she was then roughly told to get off the table and take her stand near it at a place pointed out by her purchaser who was a rollickinglooking bigwhiskered fellow with an immense leghorn hat the brim of which was lined with black and having a broad black ribbon round the crown as the poor woman got down she cast a furtive glance at her children who although the auctioneer certainly tried to prevent it were sold to two individuals neither of whom was the purchaser of the parent the poor woman looked about in great despair while the bidding was going on it was in vain i sought one sympathizing look in that company but how could it be expected when it consisted of men long inured to such heartless scenesmen whose hearts were casehardened by the impious traffic they were now engaged in i was however pleased to hear afterwards that the purchasers all resided in st louis and that the woman would often see her childrenpoor amends it is true for a cruel separation but more satisfactory than such cases generally are chapter iv where willothewisps and glowworms shine in bulrush and in brake where waving mosses shroud the pine and the cedar grows and the poisonous vine is spotted like the snakelongfellow from st louis on the missouri river i took passage to new orleans in one of those magnificent steamers that crowd the inland waters of the american continent and which sumptuously furnished as they are have not inaptly been termed floating palaces we had a prosperous passage as far as the junction of the ohio with the mississippi where the boat struck the branches of a large tree that had been washed into the bed of the stream and was there stuck fast root downwards this formidable chevauxdefrise or snag as it was termed by the captain fortunately did not do much damage to the vessel although at first an alarm was raised that she was sinking and much confusion ensued this apprehension was however soon dissipated by the report of the carpenter whose account of the damage was so far favourable that after extrication by backing the vessel and a few temporary repairs she was again got under headway the pellucid waters of the ohio as they enter the turbid rushing current of the mississippi which is swollen by the illinois and other tributaries has a remarkable effect the clear current of the former river refusing for a considerable distance to mingle with the murky stream of the latter and forming a visible blue channel in its centrea phenomenon i thought allegorical of the slavestained condition of the one state and the free soil of the other for while ohio is free from the curse of slavery the banks of the mississippi have for centuries been deep dyed in the lifes blood of the oppressed african our vessel was borne on the rushing waters with great impetuosity the maddening current of the mississippi seeming to carry everything before it as we proceeded we constantly saw trees topple over into the river the banks of which are continually widening and which in many parts has the appearance of a lake after a storm impregnated with debris the trees thus washed into the bed of the river sink root downwards and make the navigation perilous as i have before described we met numerous steamers coming up the stream one of them having a freight of indians from florida removing to the western frontier under the surveillance of us soldiery and government agents the compulsory removal of indians from one remote state to another whenever new territory is needed forms a disgraceful feature in internal american policy transported to new hunting grounds the poor indians are brought into contact with other tribes when feuds arise from feelings of jealousy and the newcomers are often annihilated in a few years many tribes have thus become totally extinct and the remainder are rapidly becoming so as the steamer passed us with her freight of red men they set up a loud yell which reverberated through the forests on the rivershores it sounded to me very much like defiance and probably was for they execrate the white men as hereditary enemies and feel deeply the wrongs inflicted on their people all the steamers we met were more or less crowded with passengers the visages of many of whom bore traces of fever and ague and who were doubtless removing to a healthier climate this insidious disease often terminates fatally in the cities and districts skirting the swamps of louisiana and to avoid its baneful effects the more affluent people migrate southwest or north when the sickly season sets in the yellow fever is also very fatal in such situations and annually claims numbers of victims we had by this time reached that latitude where perpetual summer reigns the banks of the mighty mississippi which has for ages rolled on in increasing grandeur present to the eye a wilderness of sombre scenery indescribably wild and romantic the bays formed by the current are choked with palmetto and other trees and teem with alligators watersnakes and freshwater turtle the former basking in the sun in conscious security overhead pelicans paroquets and numberless other strange bright birds on their starry wings bear the rich hues of all glorious things while the gorgeous magnolia in luxuriant bloom and a thousand other evergreens on shore vie with voluptuous aquatic flowers to bewilder and delight the astonished traveller accustomed hitherto only to the more unassuming productions of the sober north everything here was new strange and solemn the gigantic trees encircled by enormous vines and heavily shrouded in grey funereal moss mournfully waving in the breezethe doleful nightcry of the deathbird and the whippoorwillthe distant bugle of the advancing boatsthe moan of the turbid current beneaththe silent and queenly moon above appearing nearer larger and brighter than in our cooler latitudesthe sultry atmosphereand most of all perhaps the sense of the near vicinity of death in this infected regionoppressed my spirit with an ominous feeling of solemnity and awe as we passed the plantations which here and there varied the scene gangs of negroes could be seen at labourtheir sturdy overseers of ruffianly mien prowling sulkily about watching every motion of the bondsmen whip in hand which weapon they applied with the most wanton freedom as if the poor sufferers were as destitute of physical sensation as they themselves were of moral or humane feeling armed with a huge bowieknife and pistols these embruted creatures were very cutthroats in appearance and it is well known there that their conduct in general towards those they lord over justifies the appellation i have given them the steamer halted at intervals to take in wood which is invariably used instead of coal as in england this is piled in parrallelograms on the banksthe logs being split longitudinally this forms a source of good profit and is in many instances the chief maintenance of the squalid settlers of these plaguestricken and unwholesome places after the measurement of the pile by the mate or captain the deckpassengers and boathands stow it away in the vicinity of the furnacesit being part of the terms of passage that the lower order of passengers shall assist in the operation this is much disliked by the latter and many of the germans of this class on board endeavoured to escape the laborious duty by hiding amongst the packages on deck a general search was however instituted by the officers of the vessel just before it stopped at a woodingstationand the skulkers were brought out amidst the clamorous jeers of their fellows the class of passengers i have just referred to consisted chiefly of germans and irish who although there is no professed distinction bargain for a deckpassage the charge being better suited to their means amongst the objects that arrested my attention as our vessel floated majestically down the turbid current were gibbets standing on the banks depending from several of which were short chains doubtless required occasionally in carrying out this kind of discipline as the horrifying objects occurred at intervals of a few miles i at first imagined they were cranes used to lower bales of cotton into the holds of vessels and addressing a passenger whose physiognomy prepossessed me in his favour and who had several times shown a disposition to impart the knowledge he possessed concerning the objects around he soon convinced me of my mistake adding that such engines were as necessary to the proper discipline of the negroes in that latitude as the overseer himself he then proceeded to detail several instances of fugitive negroes being dragged in capture to the foot of the gallows where with halterencircled necks they were made not only to acknowledge the error committed and expose accessories but pumped dry as he facetiously termed it as to the intended flight of other negroes on the estate sometimes he said it was necessary to suspend the culprit for a moment or so to intimidate but this was only in cases where the victim he used the word rascal was inclined to be sullen and refused readily to give the required information i inquired whether it ever occurred that actual execution took place to this my new acquaintance replied wall yes where the nigger had dard to strike a white man but that it was usual to go to a magistrate first in such cases the appearance of these gibbets after the information i had received respecting them from my slaveholding acquaintance made my flesh creep as we steamed onwards the more so as in many of the grounds skirting the river where these sombre murkylooking objects presented themselves to the gaze of the traveller gangs of negroes were at work looking up complacently for a moment as the vessel glided by i was subsequently told by a gentleman who had been long resident in the state of louisiana that no punishment so effectually strikes with terror the negro mind as that of hanging the very threat being sufficient to subdue in general the most hardened offenders this i do not wonder at for perhaps there are few fieldhands living in the south but have at some time or other witnessed the barbarities used at a negro execution sudden death by pistol or bowie knife being far preferable to the brutal sneers and indignities heaped upon the victim by the cowardly assassins who superintend such operations the monotony of the scenes which had for a thousand miles rendered the passage irksome began to break as we approached natchez this place takes its name from the natchitoches or red river which falls into the mississippi the abbreviation being a corruption of the original indian name which is as above stated the town stands on a declivity or bluff and is of considerable extent i did not visit it although the boat halted for a considerable time to land letterbags and passengers i was informed by a fellowpassenger of gentlemanly bearing who resided in the vicinity that it was a dissipated place and gambling the chief occupation of its inhabitants the locality has been remarkable for landslips owing to the siliceous nature of the soil i saw traces of a fearful catastrophe of the kind which had some time before buried or destroyed many of the houses and their occupants the enormous mass having also sunk several steamboats and other vessels which were moored at the foot of the bluff under the town after leaving natchez we steamed away with renewed vigour towards that centre of slavery and dissipation new orleans and were in due course moored to the levee which extends the whole riverlength of the city and is about a mile in extent the first news i heard and which alarmed me not a little was that the yellow fever was at this time raging in the city new orleans is just fiftyfour miles from the mouth of the mississippi and being built at the time of the orleans regency contains many ancient structures its inhabitants even to this day are to a great extent either french or of gaelic origin it lies exceedingly flat which causes the locality to be unhealthy and illsuited to european constitutions the soil is however fertile and rich this is perhaps to be accounted for by the constant irrigation it undergoes from the overflowing of the mississippi which like another nile periodically submerges the country around its banks the town is situated on the east side of the river the vast quantity of shipping of all classes in the harbour is a very striking feature in this extensive and wealthy city the bad eminence to which new orleans has attained is painful to contemplate its wealth is purchased by the blood and tears of thousands of slaves who are daily exposed like cattle in its markets and this fact operates on the mind of an englishman to the prejudice of its inhabitants i was myself filled with disgust towards the whites as well as pity towards the blacks on beholding immediately on our arrival a gang of forty or fifty negroes of both sexes and nearly all ages working in shackles on the wharf these i was informed were principally captured fugitives they looked haggard and careworn and as they toiled with their barrows with uncovered heads under a burning sun they were mercilessly lashed with a heavy slavewhip by a tall athletic negro who acted as overseer and who with refined cruelty dispensed the punishment alike on stout men slender youths and thin attenuated females our arrival having attracted the notice of the gang and induced a momentary halt in their work the unfeeling wretch commenced a furious onslaught with the whip each crack of which followed as it was by the groans or cries of the sufferer roused the indignant feelings of the passengers many of whom were from the free states and who simultaneously raised a yell of execration which made the welkin resound and caused the cruel driver to stand aghast this demonstration drew a remonstrance from the captain who represented to the passengers the danger of such conduct and concluded by observing that if it was repeated it would probably arouse the indignation of the citizens who were very bigoted he should be sorry he added to be obliged to put the vessel about again a proceeding that might be necessary for the safety of all on board unless they were more cautious some of the passengers seemed disposed to dispute this argument but they were overruled by the majority who better acquainted with southern usages prejudices and barbarities thought that discretion under the circumstances would be the better part of valour i afterwards found that the captains view was a strictly correct one for so jealous are the citizens of men entertaining hostility to the proslavery cause that spies are often sent on board newlyarrived boats to ascertain if missionaries are amongst the passengers these spies with jesuitical art introduce themselves by making apparently casual inquiries on leading topics of those they suspect and if their end is subserved basely betray them or what is more usual keep them under strict surveillance with a view to their being detected in disseminating abolition doctrines amongst the slaves when they are immediately made amenable to the laws and are fined or imprisoned on landing i hired a sorry conveyance driven by a creole and drawn by a mule and had my luggage taken to a house in the suburbs where i had been recommended to take up my residence during my stay which owing to the presence of the yellow fever that daily carried off numbers of victims i had determined contrary to my original intention should be short the crowds of people on the levee attracted by the constant arrival of steamboats had a motley appearance many of these were roughlooking fellows fit for any occupation most of them being armed with bowie knives the silver hilts of which could often be seen peering suspiciously from under the waistcoat in the inner lining of which a case or scabbard of leather is sewn for the reception of the weapon the vast proportion of blacks in the streets soon struck me i should think they were five to one of the white population these for the most part wore in wretched plight many of them begged of the passersby which practice i found afterwards to be very general especially in the suburbs of the city amongst the passengers on our boat was a person apparently of the better class who was met at the levee by two black servants with a carriage i noticed particularly that although the negroes touched their hats and inquired how he was by which i concluded he had been absent for some time he did not deign to answer their inquiries from their timidity it was evident that he was an overbearing man and the imperial haughtiness manifested in giving them his orders confirmed this impression this individual was one of those who condemned the demonstration i have noticed when the boat first approached the levee after a days rest at my boardinghouse i walked through the city and afterwards visited the calaboose which in new orleans is a mart for produce as well as a place of detention and punishment for slaves here those owners who are averse to correcting their slaves in a rigorous manner at home send them to be flogged the brutal way in which this is done at the calaboose strikes terror into the negro mind and the threat is often sufficient to tame the most incorrigible instances i was told have often occurred of negroes expiring under the severity of the discipline here but it was remarked that the pecuniary loss attendant on such casualties made the keepers careful not to exceed the physical endurance of the sufferer and that they were so well acquainted with negro constitutions that it was a rare exception for death to ensue the punishment however almost always resulted in the victim being invalided and unfitted for exertion for a considerable time i believe new orleans to be as vile a place as any under the sun a perfect ghetto or cursed place in fact it is the rendezvous of renegades of all nations and hordes of negro traders and planters are to be seen flocking round the hotels these are extensive patrons of the gamblinghouses and the faro rougeetnoir roulette and other establishments fitted up with gorgeous saloons are generally crowded with them as you pass you may observe the frequenters of such places in dozens deeply engaged in play while the teller of the establishment sits at a table with a huge heap of spanish doubloons or mexican mill dollars before him which he adds to or takes from with the tact of a bankers clerk as the chances of luck may arise violence and woodshed have been indigenous to this city from time immemorial and feuds are instantly settled by an appeal to the bowie knife or everready revolver highway robberies are very frequent and i was told it was more than your life was worth to be out after dark in certain localities unless armed and on your guard the police authorities are nevertheless vigilant and the magistrates severe so that many desperadoes are brought to justice the suburbs of new orleans lie low and the swampy soil emits a poisonous miasma this is without doubt the cause of virulent epidemics that visit the city annually with direful effect thousands fly to the northern states to escape the contagion but there are many who for want of means are obliged to risk a continued residence at such periods and it is amongst those that the yellow fever the ague or the flux plays dreadful havoc it is the custom for the small storekeepers as well as the more affluent merchants to confide their affairs at such seasons to others and i have frequently seen advertisements in the new orleans picayune and other papers offering a gratuity to persons to undertake the charge in their absence the heat although the summer was not far advanced was excessive and the thousands of mosquitoes that filled the air especially after a fall of rain when they seemed to burst into life in myriads spontaneously kept up an increasing annoyance at night this was tenfold for notwithstanding the gauze awnings or bars as they are called which completely enveloped the bedstead to the floor of the room they found admittance with pertinacious audacity and kept up a buzzing and humming about my ears that almost entirely deprived me of rest this unceasing nuisance in the hot season makes it difficult to keep ones equanimity of temper and has probably much to do with that extreme irascibility shown by the southern inhabitants of the american continent the appearance and situation of hundreds of quadroon females in this city soon attracted my attention and deserve notice i saw numbers of them not only at the bazaars or shops making purchases but riding in splendid carriages through the streets so prodigal are these poor deluded creatures of their money that although slaves and liable to immediate sale at the caprice of their keepers they have often been known to spend in one afternoon  dollars in a shopping excursion endowed with natural talents they are readily instructed in every accomplishment requisite to constitute them charming companions often as a carriage dashes by the pedestrian is able to catch a glimpse of some jewelled and turbaned sultana of dazzling beauty attended by her maid who does not always possess a sinecure for the mistress is often haughty proud and petulant very hard to please and exacts great deference from her inferiors many of them live in regal splendour and everything that wealth and pampered luxury can bestow is theirs as long as their personal charms remain but when their beauty has ceased to gratify the passions of their masters they are in most instances cast off and frequently die in a condition which presents the greatest possible contrast to their former gay but not happy life oh that they had earlier died sleeping calmly side by side where the tyrants power is oer and the fetter galls no more many of such poor outcasts are to be found scattered all over the slave states some employed as field hands but in general they are selected as domestics their former habits of luxury and ease rendering their constitutions too delicate for the exposure of ordinary field labour it is not however as the reader will have observed commiseration that saves them from that degradation as soon as beauty begins to fade which in southern climes it does prematurely the unfeeling owners of these unfortunates succeed in ridding themselves of what is now considered a burden by disposing of the individual to some heartless trader this is done unknown to the victim and the news when it reaches her drives her almost frantic she at once seeks her perfidious paramour and finds to her dismay that he has been gone some days on a tour to the provinces and is perhaps a thousand miles off tears and protestations avail her nothing the trader is inexorable she belongs to him by law and go she must at length having vainly expended her entreaties she becomes calm and submits in sullen apathy to her wretched fate this is the ordinary history of such cases considering it unsafe to remain longer in this infected city from the reports that the fever was gaining ground i now made preparations for leaving new orleans and as i had made an engagement to manage the affairs of a gentleman in florida during his absence at washington i determined to proceed thither with the least possible delay in furtherance of this object i made inquiries for a conveyance by water to st marks giving the preference to steam in this object i was however disappointed and was obliged to take a passage on board a brig about to sail for that obscure port the vessel was towed down to the balize or mouth of the mississippi in company with two others by a departing steamer which had on board the mail for bermuda and st georges island arrived at the balize whose banks for several miles are overflowed by the sea i saw a small fleet of vessels some outward and some inward bound amongst these was a united states ship of war of great beauty carrying heavy guns a boat from this vessel in charge of an officer boarded us and delivered to the captain a sealed packet which i understood to be a dispatch addressed to general taylor the officer in command of the troops operating against the indians in florida the coast about the balize is low and swampy and everywhere abounds in rush and cane brakes which give its seabeach a desolate appearance these morasses harbour thousands of alligators whose roar had a singular effect as it rose above the breeze flocks of aquatic birds were to be seen on every side the most numerous being the pelican and a bird of the cotinga species about the size of an english throstle the plumage of which being jet black and flamingo red had a beautiful effect in the sunshine as they flew or settled in thousands on the canes our passage across the gulf of mexico was a favourable one but when within forty miles of our destination the vessel struck on a hidden sandbank the fog was so dense that the captain had been mistaken in his reckoning and had taken a wrong course for a considerable time we were in great jeopardy and every attempt to get the ship again afloat was unavailing and had not the weather been moderate there is little doubt but that she would have been lost and our lives placed in great peril after some hours exertion during which an anchor was lost and a quantity of iron thrown overboard we had the satisfaction to find that the vessel was adrift this was a great relief to us for had a gale sprung up in the night which was closing in we must have taken to the boat and abandoned the vessel a perilous undertaking from which we all felt too happy to have escaped i was told by the captain that the coast here abounds with hidden sandbanks of the description we had encountered this perhaps together with the poor harbour accommodation in florida accounts for the small size of the vessels which generally trade there the desolate look of the coast from the deck of the vessel did not convey to my mind a very favourable impression of the country and the hostile disposition of the indians tended not a little to excite forebodings of evil that at one time almost induced me to abandon my intention and return to the north these apprehensions were however allayed by the representations of the captain of the vessel who stated that the indians seldom attempted to molest armed parties and that an understanding with the government was daily expected through the recent capture of some important sachems or chiefs under whose influence and leadership hostilities had been carried on this information reassured me and i determined to proceed although i found afterwards that it was almost entirely a misrepresentation which however i cannot believe was wilful as the captain would have had me for a passenger on the return voyage i soon after landed in a boat from the shore the bay or harbour of st marks is not attractive neither is the town which presents a desolate appearance the houses or stores are chiefly of wood painted white the venetian blinds of the houses being green as in most parts of the united states the hotelentrances were crowded with loungers in snowwhite clothing large leghorn or palmetto hats and fancycoloured shirts who smoked cigars incessantly and generally discussed with energy the inroads of the indians or other leading topics of the day the houses are low and irregularly built and the appearance of the whole place and its inhabitants as far as i could see wore a forbidding aspect and was indicative of anything but prosperity my next stage was to tallahassee by railroad through a desolatelooking country whose soil was sand and whose vegetation looked stunted presenting little to cheer the senses or call forth remark in fact everything around told of a country whose centre is flourishing but whose frontiers are a wilderness just before we started a welldressed negro apparently a footman or butler applied for a seat in the carriage he was told by the stationkeeper that there was no conveyance for niggers this train and he must wait for the following one he at first disputed his right to refuse him a passage in the carriage which roused the ire of the stationkeeper who threatened to kick him if he was not soon off this seemed to awe him for he quietly left the station muttering however as he went his intention of reporting the circumstance to colonel gambole this caused me to make some inquiry about the colonel whose name he had mentioned and who i learned was his master i was also informed that no negroes in that district were so insolent owing to the indulgence with which all his hands were treated i could see however that the negro had different men to deal with here and if he had not taken his departure he would without a doubt have been kicked or felled to the ground on the least further provocationa course pursued without hesitation in cases where a negro assumes anything like equality in the south chapter v the fragrant birch above him hung her tassels in the sky and many a vernal blossom sprung and nodded careless by but there was weeping far away and gentle eyes for him with watching many an anxious day were sorrowful and dimbryant florida in which state i now found myself is divided into east west and middle it is a wild extent of country about  miles from north to south the king of spain held possession of the territory in  but it was afterwards ceded by treaty to the federal government it was discovered in  by sebastian cabot st augustine is the capital of east and pensacola of west florida this country is for the most part a howling wilderness and is never likely to become thickly populated the dreary pinebarrens and sandhills are slightly undulating and are here and there thickly matted with palmetto in pursuance of my original design i had now to penetrate nearly a hundred miles into the interior and as the indians and fugitive negroes were scouring that part of the country in hostile bands i contemplated this part of my route with no little anxiety i determined however to proceed the journey lay through a wild country intersected with streams and rivers every one of which swarmed with alligators this although not a very pleasant reflection did not trouble me much as i had by this time become acquainted with the propensities of these creatures and knew that they were not given to attacking white men unless provoked or wounded although a negro or a dog is never safe within their reach they are however repulsivelooking creatures and it is not easy to divest the mind of apprehension when in their vicinity my destination was an inlet of the sea called deadmans bay from whence it was my intention after transacting some business i had undertaken to take passage by steamer to cuba intending to return to the continent after a limited stay there and on some of the adjacent islands in this however i was disappointed as i shall byandby show my plan was to travel by easy stages under escort and encamp out at night so having secured the services of six men who were well armed and mounted on horseback and having furnished ourselves with a tent and other necessaries which were carried by individuals of the party we left tallahassee on our way inland under a scorching sun we could proceed but slowly after reaching the pinebarrens the soil of which is loose sand and at every step the animals we rode sank to the fetlock which caused them to be greatly fatigued at the close of the day at nightfall after selecting our ground adjacent to a river we pitched our tent and supper was prepared this consisted of jerked venison dried by a slow fire broiled turkey two of which we had shot upon our way bread and coffee one of our party walked round our position as a sentinel and was relieved every two hours it being necessary to keep a vigilant look out on account of the indian and runaway negro marauders who roam through these wilds in bands and subsist chiefly in plundering farms and small parties a huge fire of resinous pine branches which are plentiful in these solitudes and strew the ground in all directions blackened with fire and age was blazing to keep off the wolves and catamounts whose terrific yells in conjunction with other beasts prevented our sleeping they did not however venture within rifle shot the indians on attacking small parties have a practice of imitating the cry of the wolf and this circumstance being known to us tended not a little to raise our suspicions on hearing the fearful howlings that rang through the wilderness in the morning we proceeded through barren sandplains skirted with dense hammocks jungles and forests we were much annoyed by mosquitoes and sandflies which kept the whole party in discomfort from their attacks duskylooking deerflies constantly alighted on our faces and hands and made us jump with the severity of their bites as did also a large fly of brilliant mazarine blue colour about the size of a humble bee the name of which i have forgotten in crossing one of the numerous streams we had to wade or swim our horses over an incident occurred which rather alarmed me i was on a horse of that arabian blood build and spirit so common in saddlehorses in america and a little in advance of the party when i reached a river that intersected our track and which we had to cross after allowing the animal to quench its thirst i applied spurs and urged it into the stream it being averse from some cause to take the water the stream was however deeper than i anticipated and the horse immediately began to stumble and flounder in an alarming manner showing that the river bed was uneven and rocky about halfway across was a small island that divided the stream which after much difficulty he reached resting here about a minute i again urged him forward but the animal seemed very reluctant to go he wheeled short round snorted loudly as if in fear and was evidently in unusual alarm after some coaxing he however plunged into the water and i expected to be able to gain the opposite shore in advance of my companions but just as we were halfway between the little island and the opposite bank which was very steep the horse again became restive rearing as if dreadfully frightened i had the greatest difficulty to keep the saddle which was a high mexican one covered with bearskin and as easy to ride in as a chair i now began to suspect the cause of his alarm the stream was one of those blacklooking currents that flow noiselessly along and which in florida always harbour the largestsized alligators when i first came to it i remembered this and thinking to frighten off any of these lurkers that might be in the vicinity i had dashed precipitately into the stream this practice or shouting loudly and firing a pistol into the water usually succeeds i soon found out however that the presence of one of the ugly creatures was the cause of the horses trepidation for within six feet of us i discerned a pair of eyes set in huge brown excrescences fixed intently on me and my horse with malicious gaze i knew they belonged to a veteran and dreading lest its snout might be within two feet of my leg for the old alligators boast enormous length of jaw i sat tailorwise in my saddle and levelled my rifle at the horrid object the reptile had however observed my movements and disappeared beneath the surface i instantly discharged my piece in the direction he had taken and certainly gave him a lesson for the water around me was directly after tinged with blood he was probably hurt severely or he might have resented my temerity i soon after reached the shore in safety where i was speedily joined by the escort who saw nothing of the reptile in their way across and who being men bred amongst such scenes and totally divested of fear at once took the water although they had witnessed the encounter the cayman of south america is very ferocious and is popularly styled the hyena of the alligator tribe this savage creature will instantly attack a man or a horse and on this account the indians of chili before wading a stream take the precaution of using long poles to ascertain its presence or to drive it away naturalists assert that the cayman is not found in the north american rivers and i should imagine this to be correct for although engaged in many alligator hunts i found from personal experience and minute inquiry that the species found in north america is harmless if unmolested after a laborious ride we arrived at fort andrews where we found a military station of us infantry we halted here for several days i having business requiring my attention and ourselves and our beasts needing to recruit our strength before continuing our route to the bay the forest scenery here almost defies description immense cedars and other lordly trees rear their gigantic and lightningscathed heads over their smaller and less hardy but graceful neighbours cactuses mimonias and tropical shrubs and flowers which at home are to be seen only in conservatories or greenhouses are here in profusion and plants at whose name the verse feels loath fill the place with a monstrous undergrowth prickly and pulpous and blistering and blue livid and starred with a lurid hue while innumerable forms of insect and reptile life from the tiny yellow scorpion to the murky alligator of eighteen feet in length give a forbidding aspect to the scene racoons squirrels wild turkeys pelicans vultures quails doves wild deer opossums chickmuncks white foxes wild cats wolvesare ever and anon to be seen among the high palmetto brakes and the alligators in the bayous arid swamps make night hideous with their discordant bellowings and the vile odour which they emit the tout ensemble of the place brings to recollection those striking lines of hood oer all there hung the shadow of a fear a sense of mystery the spirit daunted and said as plain as whisper in the ear the place is haunted during my stay at fort andrews a large detachment of us troops arrived continuing a campaign against the recreant indians and negroes the appearance of the men and officers was wretched in the extreme they had for weeks been beating through swamps and hammocks thickly matted with palmetto bush which had torn their undress uniforms in tatters searching for an invisible enemy who thoroughly acquainted with the everglades defied every attempt at capture the whole party looked harassed disappointed and forlorn general taylor was with and had command of this detachment which was about  strong as i had heard this man vauntingly spoken of in the north as the brave cotemporary of scott i felt no little curiosity to see him his appearance surprised me he was a burly unmilitarylooking man of most forbidding aspect and much more like a yeoman than a soldier a sword much out of place dangled awkwardly by his side and was the only badge of his profession about him except a black leathern cap otherwise he was habited as a private citizen his small army encamped below the fort and as i thought in most ungeneral style he superintended the erection of his own marquee he had with him several negroes who were his body servants and the coarse epithets he applied to them during the operation did not prepossess me in his favour or i thought reflect much credit on his refinement at nightfall cries of distress arose from the marquee and as i approached it i could distinctly hear one of the bondsmen earnestly pleading for mercy listening for a moment i heard this distinguished general exclaiming vociferously and belabouring the poor negro heavily with a rawhide whip most likely venting the spleen he felt at his nonsuccess against the indians the expedition having hitherto been unsuccessful the poor negro had offended his master by some trivial act no doubt and in southern style he was correcting him without much regard it is true to publicity this in southern latitudes is so common that it is thought little of and the occurrence caused on this occasion only a passing remark from those present the negro was his own and he had a right it was stated to correct him as and when he pleased who could dispute it for my own part i entertained the most abhorrent feelings towards a man who without sense of shame or decent regard for his station thus unblushingly published his infamy amongst strangers and this man a wouldbe patriot too and candidate for the presidential chair which it will be remembered he afterwards obtained i was told that flogging his negroes was a favourite pastime with this eminentlydistinguished general and that he was by no means liked by his officers or men his appearance bespoke his tyrannical disposition and this coupled with incapacity there is little doubt conduced to make it necessary for him to relinquish his command of the army of the south which he did not long after being succeeded i believe by general armstead as i mentioned before the force that accompanied him was in forlorn case reminding me strongly of shaksperes description of falstaffs ragged regiment it consisted chiefly of raw undrilled troops quite unused to discipline but perhaps as effective as veterans in the service in which they were employed the adroitness of the enemy accustomed to the interminable swamps hammocks and canebrakes which abound in this country quite paralyzing the energies of the men and destroying that esprit du corps without which no success can be expected in an army several indian sachems or chiefs accompanied the command these were finelooking fellows but appeared exhausted from long marching through the wilderness one of these named powell particularly attracted my notice he was a very interesting young man of feminine aspect and little resembling his stalwart companions he had originally been captured but by kind treatment had been brought over to friendly views and was now acting as a guide it was stated that his father was much incensed against him and had employed emissaries to despatch him secretly a few months after this campaign i heard that he was shot while out hunting no doubt at the instigation of his unnatural parent who preferred his death to his continuing in league with white men leaving fort andrews i now pushed onward to deadmans bay the country we passed through was much the same as i have before described the journey took us the better part of two days on the way we saw a herd of wild cattle which scoured the plain in consternation on espying our party urging on our horses we tried to bring one down but they outstripped us some miles farther on and near a thick hammock about a quarter of a mile ahead a huge black bear stood snuffing the air we again put spurs to our horses to try to intercept his retreat but he was too quick for us and made at his utmost speed a sort of shambling trot for the coppice or jungle which he soon entered and disappeared from our sight at nightfall a pack of ravenous wolves headed by a large white one serenaded us and came near enough to our campfire to seize a small terrier belonging to one of the party the poor animal unused to the dangers around had the temerity to run out and bark at the packhe soon after gave one agonizing yelp and we never saw him again as a reprisal three of the party fired and brought one of the wolves to the ground he was of great size and i should say could have carried away a sheep or a good sized hog of which they are very fond with ease we could not however skin himhe was so infested with fleas in the settlements they often seize and carry off children but they do not molest adults as we proceeded we kept a vigilant lookout for indians a number of whom we had heard at fort andrews had been driven in the direction we were travelling we fortunately escaped molestation but saw in several places human bones probably the relics of a former combat between the united states troops or travellers like ourselves and indians or negroes one skull i picked up had been split with a tomahawk besides having a bullethole in it about the region of the left ear our situation was one of great peril but i had made up my mind to proceed at all hazards despite the opposition shown by two or three of the settlers composing my escort who on more than one occasion pointed out indian campgrounds of only a few days age at one of these we found a quantity of indian flour or arrowroot part of a bridle and the offal of a calf but we left the former imagining it might be poisoned the latter was of no use our only dog having been devoured by the wolves passing through a dense hammock of a quarter of a mile in width through which the pioneers of the american army had recently cut a rough road i dismounted to take a view of these sombre shades on either hand the solemn stillness around seemed to me like the shadow of deathespecially so from the peril we were in through the deadly feud existing at the time between the indians and white men i penetrated for full a quarter of a mile into this fastness in a lateral direction and in doing so suddenly startled two immense white birds of the adjutant species which were standing in a swamp surrounded by majestic cedar trees i could easily have brought one down with my rifle but i thought it wanton cruelty to do so they were i should think quite six feet high and beautifully white with a yellow tinge the head of one which i suppose was the male bird was surmounted by a golden crest they sailed quietly away over my head not appearing much alarmed by the intrusion in these primeval shades where perhaps the foot of man never before trod for i looked in vain for such traces are many beasts birds and reptiles which live in perfect security for although the indian dwells here and subsists by hunting yet the territory is so vast and the red men are so few in proportion that there can be little doubt that many places are untraversed emerging on the open sandplain somewhat unexpectedly i caused my party no little alarm they instinctively grasped their rifles imagining the approach of a party of hostile indians the constant dread of molestation causes the traveller here to be ever on the quivive the precaution being highly necessary to prevent surprise the least movement in a coppice excites apprehension and fills the soul of both the resolute and the timorous with anticipations of danger nor are these fears groundless for the treacherous indian crawls stealthily to the attack and without a moments warning two or three of a party may fall to the earth pierced by rifleballs or rearing horses may throw the riders and leave them at the mercy of these ruthless assassins arriving at length at the bay in safety i was accommodated in the officers quarters of a temporary fort or stockade erected there the steamer had left so that i was compelled to remain here longer than i had intended awaiting the arrival of the next boat to beguile the time i went for miles into the forests looking for game often coming back disappointed and weary at others rewarded by perhaps a racoon or what i valued more a fawn or wild turkey there was however plenty of sport on the river and thousands of wild ducks gannet and pelicans inhabited the little islands in the vicinity and reared their young there some of these islands being covered with their eggs large numbers of alligators infested the streams adjacent and their bellowings in concert with bullfrogs and other reptiles often banished sleep for nights together although i was pretty well accustomed to such annoyances snakes were often to be met with although harmless if unmolested amongst these the moccason hoop and garter snakes of which i procured several specimens were the most common to be met with rattlesnakes exist in rocky districts but i saw none of them here the steamer not arriving as i anticipated after remaining for a considerable time and getting tired of so solitary a life i determined to retrace my steps to tallahassee while remaining at this post a party of mounted volunteers arrived from georgia these men were mostly sons of farmers who had suffered from the unceasing attacks of the indians on their farms in many instances accompanied by the butchery of some members of their families it was arranged that a company of us infantry stationed at the fort should act in concert with these men and scour the country for twenty miles round to search for indians traces of whom had been seen and who it was very certain were encamped not many miles off as i felt desirous of observing the operations of these little campaigns against so wily a foe i intimated to a major my intention of accompanying the expedition he was pleased with the proposal and furnished me with a splendid rifle and other equipments from the stores of the depot after a short delay owing to the nonarrival of some waggons that were intended to accompany the expedition the whole force mustered in front of the stockade enclosure and being furnished with ten days provisions for man and horse started under command of the major aforesaid across the sandplains in order to reach a dense cedar and cypress swamp ten miles distant where it was suspected the enemy was concealed after a tedious march through a wild country so overgrown with saw palmetto and underbrush that our horses had great difficulty to get through it we arrived at the skirts of the swamp here a consultation took place between the officers present and it was arranged that an indian guide whom we had with us should go in and hold a parley with the indians to induce them if possible to surrender the guide went into the hammock which extended along the edge of the swamp as far as the eye could reach right and left i should have mentioned that this man with the usual indian acuteness had discovered indubitable signs that the enemy was in the vicinity long before we reached the spot after an absence of about an hour during which time we refreshed ourselves and made preparations for an expected struggle our guide returned bringing with him a bow and quiver of arrows as proofs of his interview with the secreted indians the account he gave which was interpreted by a halfbred indian who accompanied the expedition for the purpose was that after penetrating some distance into the fastness he came to the encampment of the enemy and was instantly surrounded by warriors who seized him but after parleying for a considerable time let him go presenting him with a bow and arrows as a symbol of their unflinching resolve to continue the war on hearing this it was at once determined by the officer in command that the whole force except a guard for the horses and waggons should go in and surprise them the guide shook his head at this and pointing towards the swamp said that is the way i have shown it to you follow it if you will i do not go it was however of no use to dally and orders were given for all hands to follow into the swamp for my own part i wished to stay behind but was told that such a course was attended with danger as the indians would most likely emerge from another part of the hammock and endeavour to seize the horses and ransack the waggons this decided my adopting the least of the two evils although i fully expected we should have a battle after penetrating for i should think upwards of two miles sometimes up to our knees in miry clay and often stopped by impassable barriers of wild vines and other prehensile plants which annoyed us greatly and made me regret a thousand times that i had courted such dangers and inconveniences the sound of two rifleshots threw the whole party into indescribable commotion supposing we were attacked all hands flew as quick as thought to the trees around where each one peeping from behind the trunks which were sought as a shelter against the rifleballs of the expected foe waited for a few moments in great suspense when suddenly a loud cheer from the party in advance followed by several rifleshots told us they had come upon the encampment as the firing ceased i knew the indians had fled this seemed also the opinion of the volunteers near me who simultaneously left their hidingplace and pushed forward to the scene on arriving at the spot i found the soldiers around a large indian fire over which was suspended a boiling cauldron filled with venison the indians having been no doubt preparing a meal when disturbed by us by the side and not far from the fire was a large trough made out of a fallen tree in which was a quantity of arrowroot in course of preparation this plant grows plentifully in this latitude and is the principal fare of the indians their squaws superintending the management of it the remains of a fine buck lay near and also some moccasons leggings and other indian gear the enemy we had so unceremoniously disturbed had as usual taken flight but we found traces of blood and the advanced party stated that they had fired on two warriors who with a woman and two children were on the spot when they came up as it was deemed quite useless to pursue them from their being no doubt well acquainted with the intricacies of the fastness and therefore sure to evade us we regaled ourselves on the venison of which some refused to partake lest it should be poisoned it was decided that the force should emerge from the swamp to the open plain about a mile above the spot where we had left the waggons by a circuitous route this was accordingly done but our progress was so difficult that the indians had ample opportunity to fly before us and we saw no further traces of them on reaching the waggons we found to our great satisfaction that all was safe and as night was approaching it was decided to encamp there a spring of turbid water being in the vicinity a cordon of sentinels was accordingly placed around our restingplace and some tents were pitched for a portion of the party the remainder wrapped in blankets sleeping on the sand after the whiskey had passed round the jocular little major in command proposed a song and as one of the infantry soldiers was an adept at the art he was invited to our marquee although in the very midst of danger for we knew not how formidable in number the indians were we passed a merry evening soon after this affair the party returned to the bay and in a day or two i started on my return to tallahassee about twenty miles from deadmans bay we overtook a fugitive negro and as we came upon him unexpectedly when turning the edge of a hammock he had not time to retreat being within riflerange or he would doubtless have done so he threw up his arms and gave a piercing shriek an unvariable custom of indians when in danger expecting to be instantly shot he had however nothing to fear having fallen in with friends and not foes as i saw he was without a rifle i dashed forward and accosted him first he was soon assured by my manner of addressing him and begged earnestly that we would not detain or hurt him this i at once promised if he would inform us whether indians were near he said no they had left that country two suns days ago taking an easterly direction and we might proceed to fort andrews in safety after putting several other questions to him i inquired if the indians would cross our path to tallahassee from that post he said no they were far off in another direction having gone to east florida eighty miles distant the fellow was in poor case and begged for food saying he was starving i therefore desired the men to supply him with some dried venison and bread which he ate with avidity he refused to tell me his masters name but said there were hundreds of negroes fighting with the indians six from the same plantation as himself my companions were at first intent upon securing him but being averse to that course i dared them to do it when seeing i was fully determined on this point they did not insist pointing to the hammock after giving him a dram of brandy i bid him be off when he darted like a deer into the thicket and disappeared from our view with a loud shout of exultation about ten miles further on as we passed the edge of a dense hammock we heard the bay of an indian dog and fearing the proximity of a party of marauders we were instantly on the alert the dog did not however come out of the wood and we rode from the dangerous vicinity with all dispatch arrived again at fort andrews without any further adventure worth recording we found a party of volunteers about to proceed to fort pleasant in the direction we were going after recruiting my now almost exhausted strength by a refreshing sleep i went down to their encampment by the rivers edge they had the day before encountered a strong party of indians whom they repulsed with loss some of the party showed me several bloody scalps of warriors they had killed i could not help remarking the beauty of the hair which was ravenblack and shone with a beautiful gloss they had several captured indian women with them and halfadozen children the former were absorbed in grief and one in particular whose young husband had been shot in the fray and whose scalp was one of those i have just mentioned was quite overwhelmed the children little conscious of the misery of their parents swam about and dived in the river like amphitrites they each carried a small bow and quiver of arrows there is no doubt the indians these volunteers had fallen in with and routed were the identical party referred to by the negro we had met some fortyeight hours before i had made up my mind to stay at fort andrews for a time partly to fulfil an engagement with a friend whom i had arranged to meet here and to whom i shall shortly have to refer more at length and partly to recruit my strength a tertian ague having seized me which much debilitated my frame and made travelling very irksome my accommodation was indifferent but medical assistance which i needed most was not wanting and i shall never forget the courtesy of the officers i employed my time chiefly in rambling the woods when health would permit and had a boat lent to me with which in company i several times penetrated the tortuous river esteenahatchie to the bay some miles distant at night the boats were all sunk or they would have been stolen or destroyed by the indians who hovered round and committed petty depredations at every opportunity below the fort was a ruinous mill in a gloomy dell through which the river wended its silent course this had once been tenanted but the inhabitants were murdered some years before by the indians who afterwards as is their almost unvarying custom added to the atrocity by setting fire to the building sitting one day after a lengthened ramble in solitary meditation on my position and the surrounding scenery i saw a fine indian who appeared greatly fatigued emerge from the adjoining hammock and walk to the edge of the stream and there after glancing round him with eager eye and air he laid down his rifle and stepping on to a tree which debouched into the stream lying as it had been struck down by a tornado he crouched down at the end of it and commenced laving himself with the water his appearance was romantic and there is no doubt from his dress he was a warrior of some note probably following his wife one of the squaws captured by the volunteers i have before mentioned and who were still at fort andrews awaiting orders from general taylor i could have shot him to a certainty had i been armed which was not the case had it been so however i was predetermined never unless in selfdefence to imbrue my hands in indian or negro blood while in the territory neither was i disposed to betray him for i deeply sympathized with the misfortunes of his race and well knew that an inexcusable spirit of aggrandizement on the part of the federal government had in the first place roused the indignation of both negroes and red men and provoked hostilities after performing his ablution the indian stalked like a deer into the recesses of the forest i having in the mean time as a matter of policy moved out of danger for he was no doubt animated with feelings of dire revenge and in a very different mood from that in which i have described myself to have been at the time during my visit to deadmans bay i had become acquainted with a scotch gentleman who was employed on the medical staff of the us army i believe as a supernumerary or candidate for a commission as a surgeon he was a most agreeable companion of good natural parts fluent in conversation intelligent in remark free from egotism and well educated i believe at cambridge in england we soon became attached to each other he accompanied me in my rambles and we were almost inseparable companions during my stay he was one of those beings in fine who seem to be sent at times to cheer the darkened highway of existence under gloomy circumstances and i fondly hoped to enjoy with him a lengthened period of virtuous intimacy and close unalloyed friendship on more propitious soil but the decrees of providence are inscrutable and his ways indeed past finding out this was certainly strikingly exemplified by the catastrophe i am about to relate which deprived me for ever of my friend when at the bay he expressed a wish to visit st marks tallahassee and apalachicola and stated his intention as soon as his engagements permitted to proceed thither by steamer if opportunity offeredor failing this to go overland availing himself of some escort which might be proceeding in that direction as i felt desirous to have his company on my route to south carolina i arranged to halt at fort andrews as before stated that he should join me there in a week and then proceed in company with me to fort pleasant forty miles distant and thence to tallahassee the time having now come at which i was expecting his arrival i was one morning anxiously looking out through the long vista of pine trees and barrens when i descried in the distance two horsemen approaching at their greatest speed i at first imagined them to be as they indeed proved an advanced party of my friends escortbut on their coming up i could see from the agitation they were in and the foaming state of their horses which were quite white and in a dreadfully exhausted state that something alarming had happened the tale was soon toldit appeared that about midway between the two settlements or stations a party of indians in ambush had fired upon the party and my friend had been treacherously murdered i was much affected by this intelligence and after some consultation with a gentleman there determined to get up a pretty strong party and proceed to the scene of the murder to collect the remains of my poor friend whose bones would otherwise be left as i had seen others in those regions to bleach on the sand hills we soon started the party consisting of fourteen men well armed with rifles bowie knives and pistols accompanied by a waggon drawn by four stout mules and driven by a negro to convey back the remains the expedition was attended with no little danger from the proximity of a newlydiscovered party of indians who were committing dreadful ravages in the districtbut whether in large or small force was uncertain they were probably the party i have before adverted to lingering about the vicinity after a melancholy journey during which we were so absorbed by our feelings that little was said we reached the fatal spot it being pointed but by one of the party who formed my friends escort it was on the edge of a dense hammock by the skirts of which lay some enormous trees which had been levelled by a recent tornado from behind this barricade the indians had unexpectedly fired on the partythe attack was so sudden that they appeared to have been quite taken by surprise this was the more extraordinary as the whole neighbourhood was of a description likely to be chosen by the red men for an ambuscade the party attacked must have been in great trepidation for from what i could glean the survivors put spurs to their horses flanks and galloped off to fort andrews leaving my poor friend entirely at the mercy of the enemy the survivor who accompanied us stated that they were riding in indian file as is customary there that poor h was in front of him and that directly the indians gave their fire he saw him fall backwards from his horse at the same time raising his left hand to his head he could tell no more the horse he was on having wheeled round suddenly and been urged on in retreat by its rider who was in the greatest imaginable terror had the party halted and returned the fire for they were well armed in all probability some of the marauders would have been laid low or if the indians were but few they might at least have rescued my poor friend we found footmarks of indians which we traced by these it appeared that they were in small force and that when h fell from his horse he recovered his feet and ran from the enemy in the direction of the plain for about two hundred yardshere it was evident he had been overtaken and his skull cloven with a tomahawk from behind we soon discovered his remains in the sand denuded of every particle of flesh and muscle by the vultures and the ravenous wolves we collected the bones with reverential care and placed them in the waggon for transit to fort andrews on the bones of the little finger of the left hand was an emerald ring which i had often seen the murdered man wear and which being covered with blood and sand at the time of the catastrophe no doubt escaped the attention of the villians who perpetrated the atrocious act the left jaw was fractured by a riflebullet which knocked him off his horse backwards as described by one of the survivors in the pines opposite the place of ambush we found several balls imbedded and one had lodged in the pummel of the saddle of the man who was present and who formed one of our party it appeared probable that there were not more than four or five indians engaged in the attack a force which might easily have been repelled and annihilated with ordinary courage but formidable enough to men wanting the presence of mind which is necessary under such circumstances after a fatiguing journey for which i was at the time almost totally unfitted by illhealth our party reached fort andrews with the mangled remains of the victim a short time afterwards these were committed to the sand a military salute being fired over the grave by some soldiers at the garrison on an elevated slab of wood to the north of fort andrews may be seen a zinc plate erected by me to the memory of my friend with his name the date of his death and an epitome of the circumstances attending it this memento of regard has in all probability escaped the cupidity of the indians for i took the precaution to have it placed as much out of sight as possible and the place of burial was off the beaten track thus perished miserably one whose generous openness and manly virtues rendered him dear to all who had the privilege of his acquaintance he was a native of somewhere near arbroath in scotland but his accent did not betray his nativity in traversing the sandy deserts of west florida i had frequent opportunities of tracing the devastating effects of those awful visitations in tropical climateshurricanes or tornadoes and notwithstanding i had the good fortune to escape the danger of being exposed to one i more than once prepared for the worst one of these was accompanied with phenomena so unusual and striking to a native of europe that i must not omit some notice of it if for no other purpose than to convey to the mind of the reader one of the many unpleasant but wonderful accompaniments of a residence in these latitudes so poetically and indeed so truthfully apostrophized as the sunny south it was while on a journey accompanied by two yeomen from east florida who were proceeding to join an expedition against the indians to defend their hearths and by the friend whose melancholy loss i have adverted to from deadmans bay towards tallahassee that the occurrence i am about to mention took place it was in the height of summer and for several days fahrenheits barometer had ranged from  to  degrees the temperature being occasionally even higher by some degrees than this we started soon after eight in the morning and had ridden all day under a scorching sun from the effects of which we were but illdefended by our palmleaf hats for our heads were aching intenselymy own being in common parlance ready to split not an inapt simile by the way as i often experienced in the south towards evening the sultriness increased to a great degree and respiration became painful from the closeness of the atmosphere a suspicious lull soon after succeeded and we momentarily expected the storm to overtake us it was not however one that was to be relieved by an ordinary discharge of thunder lightning and raindeeper causes being evidently at work the denseness of the air was accompanied by a semidarkness similar to that which prevails during an eclipse of the sun which luminary on the occasion i refer to after all day emitting a lurid glare was so shrouded in vapour as to be scarcely discernible even in outlinewhile a subterranean noise added to the terrors of our situation which strongly called to mind the accounts we read of earthquakes and similar phenomena we moved slowly on as people naturally would who were about to be overwhelmed in a calamity that threatened their annihilation while an indefinable sensation of sleepiness and inertia seized the whole of the party vultures and other birds of prey screamed dismally as they hovered round our heads in the greatest excitement arising either from terror or the anticipation of a rich repast we could not tell which these voracious creatures with great audacity often descended to within a few feet of the heads of our horses which seemed terrorstricken at their near approach i took aim at one of the largest of them with my rifle and it fell a little to my left with an impetus i can only compare to the fall of a human being directly it touched the ground it vomited carrion and died it was many feet in breadth from tip to tip of wing but we were too perturbed to stop and measure it when i discharged the rifle the report was unusually faint owing to the state of the air so much so that my companions who were not fifty yards behind scarcely heard it the wild animals in the jungle which skirted the road and which in general skulk in silence and secresy in their haunts rent the air with their howlings the very order of nature seemed about to be reversed while the long streamers of grey moss swayed backwards and forwards mournfully from the trees adding to the solemnity of the scene as the party slowly wended its way through the wilderness each individual looked round with suspicion exchanging furtive glances or now and then uttering some exclamation of alarmtheir manner and bearing indicating minds ill at ease this dismal state of things lasted nearly an hour after which time nature seemed to recover herself by a sudden throe for a brisk breeze which was highly refreshing to our senses and which was attended by the loud hollow subterranean sound i have before referred to unexpectedly sprang up and swept off as if by magic the inertia of nature what made the phenomenon more extraordinary was the total absence of thunder or lightning my companions shouted for joy when the hollow moan of the embryo tempest was heard to move off to the eastward for as they informed me it told of deliverance from peril i felt a sensation of delight i cannot describe and heartily responded to the noisy demonstration of satisfaction raised by my companions our horses apparently participating in our delight pricked up their ears and snorted fairly prancing with pleasure tired and jaded as they were after thirty miles travel through sand into which they sank at every step fetlock deep often groaning pitifully i noticed that during the impending storm they hung down their heads in a listless manner and sighed heavily a circumstance that to our minds presaged calamity and which i may add was altogether unlike the usual indication of fatigue in animals which have travelled a great distance had the tornado burst upon us instead of passing off as it did it is very doubtful whether the hand that writes this would not have been mingled with its native dust in the arid sands of florida for as we rode on we saw gigantic pine cedar and hiccory trees torn up by the roots and scattered over the surrounding country by bygone hurricanes many of them hundreds of yards from the spot that nurtured their rootswhile the gnarled branches lying across our track scorched blackwith the lightning or from long exposure to a burning sun impeded our advance and made the journey anything but pleasant the occurrence i have mentioned formed a topic of conversation for some miles as we journeyed to our destination and one of my companions stated that a few months before when in the neighbourhood of pensacola a hurricane came on unexpectedly and caused great devastation unroofing the houses tearing up trees and filling the air with branches and fragments of property he happily escaped although his little estate situated at mardyke enclosure some short distance from the town was greatly injured and some six or eight people were crushed to death by the falling trees and ruins of houses chapter vi before us visions come of slaveships on virginias coast of mothers in their childless home like rachel sorrowing oer the lost the slavegang scourged upon its way the bloodhound and his human preywhittier florida produces oranges peaches plums a species of cocoanut and musk and watermelons in abundance the more open portions of the country are dotted over with clumps of gnarled pines of a very resinous nature white and red oak hiccory cedar and cypress and is in general scantily clad with thin grass fit only for deer to browse upon the dreary sameness of the interior of this desolate country is distressing to the traveller and the journey from one settlement to another through pineforests seems almost interminable one morning a short time prior to my intended departure for tallahassee i was roused before daybreak by a rifleshot which was instantly followed by the cry of guard turn out and much hubbub as this was no unusual occurrence from the constant apprehension we were in of an attack by the indians on the stockade and as it had several times occurred before during my stay i resolved to lie and listen awhile before i rose the earnest conversation and the noise of horses soon after satisfied me it was only a friendly arrival i however felt anxious to obtain intelligence as to the success of a treaty then pending between the united states government and the indians the favourable termination of which would not only render my return to tallahassee more safe but put a stop perhaps for ever to those constant scenes of blood and depredation that were by this time become quite sickening to me this feeling was much enhanced at the time by the express between fort andrews and deadmans bay being shot by a party of the common enemy the body of this poor fellow was never found but traces of blood were to be seen near the spot where he had been attacked and the saddle and bridle of his horse were found cut into a thousand pieces the probability being that he was wounded and taken prisoner doubtless to be tortured to death a practice common with all indian tribes in time of war on my proceeding to a house used as officers quarters outside the stockade i found the stir had been caused by the arrival of two companies of lighthorse soldiers from st marks escorting several couples of bloodhounds to aid the army operating in that part of florida to exterminate the indians these dogs were very ferocious and on approaching the leashmen who had them in charge they opened in full yell and attempted to break loose the dogs had just arrived from cuba with their keepers their importation having been caused by the supposition that like the maroons in jamaica who for nearly thirty years defied the colonists there the indians would be terrified into submission this however turned out to be erroneous for on their first trial the indians killed several and the scheme was very properly abandoned a short time after such barbarous means were very unjustifiable although many to use the language of the earl of chatham when deprecating a similar course in the english house of lords considered that every means that god and nature had placed in their hands were allowable in the endeavour to bring to a close a war that had cost the federal government an immense amount of blood and treasure i am of opinion however from what i afterwards heard that the step was not an altogether popular one in the eastern and northern states although it certainly was so in the southern it being argued in the public prints there that as dogs had been used in hunting down fugitive negroes from time immemorial the mere fact of bloodhounds being used instead of mastiffs was a peccadillo unworthy of name the tobacco plant though growing in many parts of florida spontaneously like the broadleafed dock in england is often cultivated in gardenground for domestic use some of the finer kinds being as aromatic as those of cuba the soil in such places is rich indeed the plant will not thrive in many parts where this is not the case the method of propagation generally followed by the large growers is that recommended by loudon in his incomparable encyclopedia of agriculture and is as followsthe soil selected is in general loamy and deep this is well broken up before planting and frequently stirred to free it from the rich growth of weeds that in florida in particular choke the growth of all plants if neglected the seeds being small they are lightly covered with earth and then the surface is pressed down with a flat instrument used for the purpose in two months after the seedlings are ready to transplant and are placed in drills three feet apart every way these are frequently watered if there happens to be but little rain which in that arid climate is often the case for weeks together and the plants regularly looked over to destroy a species of worm winch if not removed plays great havoc with the young buds when four inches high the plants are moulded up like potatoes in england when they have six or seven leaves and are just putting out a stalk the top is nipped off to make the leaves stronger and more robust after this the buds which show themselves at the joints of the leaves are plucked and then the plants are daily examined to destroy a caterpillar of a singular form and grey in colour which makes its appearance at this stage and is very destructive to narcotic plants when fit for cutting which is known by the brittleness of the leaves the plants are cut close to the ground and allowed to lie some time they are then put in farmhouses in the chimneycorner to dry or if the crop is extensive the plants are hung upon lines in a dryinghouse so managed that they will not touch each other in this state they are left to sweat and dry when this takes place the leaves are stripped off and tied in bundles these are put in heaps and covered with a sort of matting made from the cottonfibre or seaweed to engender a certain heat to ripen the aroma care being taken lest a fermentation should occur which injures the value of the article to avoid which the bundles are exposed and spread about now and then in the open air this operation is called ventilating by the planters and is continued until there is no apparent heat in the heaps the plant is quite ornamental and its blossoms form a pleasing feature in a garden of exotic productions after a brief stay at fort andrews subsequent to the last sad offices for my deceased friend i left that spot on horseback for tallahassee in company with four settlers we soon reached the more populated districts without being molested by the indians here they had committed sad devastations we saw many farms without occupants the holders having been either murdered by midnight assassins or having fled in alarm adjoining these habitations we found line peach orchards teeming with fruit of the richest description which lay in bushels on the ground and with which we regaled ourselves enclosed maize fields overgrown with brambles and cotton fields with the gins and apparatus for packing the produce in bales for the market presented to the eye the very picture of desolation owing to cross roads we were at one time completely at fault and there being no house in sight i volunteered to ride off to the right and endeavour to obtain the information we were in need of after riding about halfamile i heard voices through a roadside coppice which i took to be those of fieldhands at work going farther on i dismounted and climbing the zigzag rail fence approached a negro at work in the field i inquired if he could put me on the road to tallahassee he appeared much frightened at the intrusion but stated he did not know but his masr did at the same time pointing to the plantationhouse situate the greater part of a mile distant being averse to going there for fear of impudent interrogation i offered him money to go with me to the point where i had left my companions and show us the way to the next house he did not even know what it was i offered him and in apparent amazement inquired what that was for i explained buy tobacco buy whiskey he appeared totally ignorant of its use and i have no doubt he had never had money in his possession or learned its use still he refused to leave the field a wise precaution as i afterwards found both for himself and me the negro being resolute there was now no alternative but to go to the house on arriving at which i met with such a reception as i had feared and anticipated three fierce dogs of the mastiff breed regularly trained to hunting fugitive negroes rushed out upon me i had only a small riding whip with me having left my firearms with a friend at fort andrews and much dreaded laceration their noise soon brought out a ferocious lankvisagedlooking man about forty years of age who immediately called off the dogs but before i had time to make the inquiry that brought me there he began in about the following strain what dye yer waunt up yar stranger arter no good i guess youd better put it bout straight i seed yer torking to the hands yondernone o yer mancipator doctrines yar the fellows address struck me all of a heap as he would himself have said had he been in my situation he spoke so fast that i could not edge in a word at last i stated the cause of my intrusion but he would not believe a word ordered me to quit the plantation or he would set the dogs on me and was getting into such an ungovernable rage that i thought it would be wise to follow his advice so i slowly retreated to the yard entrance by which i had come in returning to my companions at the crossroads i found that in my absence a passerby had given them the wishedfor information and we pushed on to a house of call a few miles distant as the ride was a long one we halted at this house for refreshment and after baiting our horses regaled ourselves upon some choice ham and eggs at the table three little negroes one girl and two boys under fourteen years of age served as waiters their clothing was supplied by nature being solely the primitive habiliments worn in eden before the fall this is quite customary in the south where the rules of decency are commonly set at defiance as if the curse of adams transgression applied not in this respect to the african race the little creatures did not seem to be in the least aware of their degraded state they were as agile as fawns and their tact in administering to the wants of the company was quite remarkable just as we were about to proceed on our journey a party of some halfadozen planters or overseers of neighbouring estates mounted on fine mules who had been searching for fugitive fieldhands rode up i could see they were greatly excited and one of them had a negro lassoed by the neck one end of the rope being fastened to his high spanish saddle on coming up to the entrance gate the one most in advance dismounted to open it the mule eager perhaps to get to a crib or what is more likely to evade a brutal kick or blow trotted through this did not please its owner who bellowed loudly to it to stop the mule however still kept on when the ruffian in demoniac anger drew from his belt a long bowie knife and darting after the animal hurled it at him with all his force the blade of the weapon which was six or seven inches long entered and stuck fast in the abdomen of the agonized creature which for about twenty yards ran on furiously with the murderous knife in its vitals it then fellwith a deep groan while the fiend who had perpetrated this wanton act of barbarity and his companions watched its fall and loudly exulted in it i noticed that there was a deep scowl of hatred on the countenance of the negro prisoner as this drama was being enacted and when the knife struck the poor mule he cried out oh masr masr societies for the suppression of cruelty to animals are as might be supposed unknown in such remote situations nor do they exist in any of the slave states and territories of america so that redress in such a case was out of the question i therefore consoled myself that the outrage had brought its own punishment in the loss of the mule which was at least worth from eighty to one hundred dollars passing onwards we reached tallahassee by rather a circuitous route via mount pleasant although in an indifferent state of health from exposure to the poisonous miasma of the country i on the whole felt pleased with my journey now that its dangers were over and grateful to the great dispenser of all good who had safely conducted me through them at tallahassee i saw in the streets in charge of a ruffianlylooking fellow two negroes with heavy iron collars round their necks these were captured runaways the collars which must have weighed seven or ten pounds had spikes projecting on either side one of the poor creatures had hold of the spikes as he walked along to ease the load that pressed painfully on his shoulders general murat resided at the time in this neighbourhood he is the brother of jehoiachin exking of naples and owns a large plantation and i was told upwards of two hundred negroes who were described as being humanely treated by him this however is a very indefinite term where all slaveowners profess to do the same though the poor wretches over whom by law they impiously assume gods heritage in ninety cases out of every hundred are scantily clothed worse fed than horses or mules and worked to the utmost extent of human endurance the humanity being in most cases left to the tender mercies of a brutal overseer who exacts all he can if the poor tattered squalidlooking beings i saw in tallahassee be a fair specimen of the humane treatment i have referred to heaven help them general murat some years ago married an american lady who delighted in being called the princess a little piece of vanity quite in keeping with the aristocratical prejudices of american females in the south who are devoted worshippers of lordly institutions and usages i did not see the general myself but was told he was often to be met lounging about the bars of the principal hotels being quite americanized in this respect he was described as a very garrulous old gentleman extremely fond of recounting his adventures particularly his escape when the allied troops entered paris about the year of bonapartes subjugation after remaining a few days in tallahassee i took the conveyance to macon in georgia intending to pursue my route overland to charleston in south carolina in the diligence a clumsy apology for a coach from tallahassee to macon were several loquacious passengers one of these amused and disgusted us by turns for after giving an epitome of his career which was a chequered one he related an incident that had recently occurred on a plantation he had been visiting and as it presents a novel feature in the asserted rights of slaveholdershow profane i will not stop to inquirei think it worth recording after a recital of a drunken debauch in which he had taken a part described by him as a frolic and which had been kept up for several days his host he said anxious to show the high sense he entertained of the honour of the visit by making almost any sacrifice this was said with great conceit proposed to put a negro up with an apple on his head in imitation of the ordeal imposed on william tell the swiss patriot declaring that he who divided the apple or perforated it with a rifleball should own the slave this proposal the gentleman very facetiously observed the party jumped at expecting some good sport but added the fellow spoilt it for he refused to stand still although we used up a cowhide over him for his obstinacy the frivolous manner in which this intended outrage was related filled me and my fellowpassengers with disgust i thought it was not safe to remark on the proceeding for i could see he was a very strenuous upholder of that disgraceful system of oppression which stigmatizes and degrades the americans as a people and will continue to do so until it is utterly abrogated and their characters retrieved this wouldbe patrician was a pedantic swaggering bully who it was evident entertained high notions of his importance and owned perhaps large possessionsin a word he was an american aristocrat and the description i have given is a fair one of his class in the south pointing to a hill as we entered a little settlement on our way to macon he exclaimed see there gentlemen twenty years ago i toiled up that hill without a cent in my wallet purse but now he continued with the air of a potentate my niggers are the sleekest in our country in those days he went on glass inkstands stood on the desks of the bank i now am chief proprietor of we have nothing but gold ones now the fellows bombast lowered him in the esteem of the passengers who seemed indisposed to listen to him and the latter part of the journey he said little being in fact regularly sent to coventry by us all he afterwards amused himself much to our annoyance by whistling airs and singing snatches of songs which caused one of the passengers a lady to leave the diligence at the next change of horses he was quite an adept at whistling the air of yankee doodle this want of deference to the sex which i must say is an exception to the general behaviour of men there and in other parts of the union i visited did not fail to call forth animadversion the remarks at one time being so pointed that i began to feel uneasy lest the pugnacious spirit might be aroused in him which leads so often in the south to serious encounters our conveyance which more resembled a waggon than a stagecoach having by this time stopped at a large hotel at macon i alighted with much pleasure for the roughness of the road the disagreeable loquacity of the passenger i have described and the recklessness of the driver made the journey excessively unpleasant the negro population in georgia is very numerous and their constant attempts to escape to the everglades in florida make unceasing vigilance on the part of their owners necessary for the safety of their property in many instances where suspicion exists they are never allowed on any pretence to leave the estate or residence of the owner at the greensborough railway terminus i noticed two negroes on their way to charleston before being allowed to take their seat in an open carriage in the rear of the train the clerk at the station stepped up to them and with an air of great effrontery demanded to see their passes these were instantly shown with an alacrity that plainly indicated fear they were then shut in a box in the rear of the train in which i could see no sitting accommodation the way in which these men were treated presented nothing new for i had invariably noticed that coloured people in the south whether bond or free were spoken to with supercilious haughtiness which i never once saw them openly resent on arriving at the next station a trader got into the carriage he had with him two negro men and a boy these were secured to each other by handcuffs and a slight negro chain for the last forty miles of my journey i had a very pleasant companion in a gentleman from the state of alabama he was a most agreeable and intelligent young fellow but invalided like myself through the poisonous miasma of the south i entered freely into conversation with him on general matters in the course of which i introduced slavery in several of its bearings i soon discovered by his bias that he was decidedly in favour of things as they are being anxious to obtain some information as to the observance of the nuptial tie amongst slaves i touched upon that subject when he told me the ceremony was mostly a burlesque and that unions were in general but temporary although he had known some very devoted couples but he proceeded to state that there was much room for reform in this respect i will relate to you an instance said he of the manner in which this as we white people consider it solemn compact is entered into amongst fieldhands when a couple wish to live together as man and wife the male nigger mentions it to the overseer and if there are no impediments they have a cabin assigned to them he described a scene of this kind which i will endeavour to give verbatim he said it occurred on his fathers estate some years before and that he was standing by at the time although he continued tis done the same now in most instances a negro approached where the overseer was standing apparently by his sidling manner about to ask some favour when the following colloquy ensued overseerwell you black rascal what do you stand grinning there for negroplease masr want lucy for wife overseerwife you scoundrel what do you want a wife for be off with you and mind your horses he was employed as a teamster on the estate negrooh masr i loves lucy overseerand she loves you i suppose a fine taste she must have indeed where are you going to live negrogot room in no  cabin if masr please let um overseerwell now listen go along and take her but you lazy dog if you get into any scrapes and dont work like live coals ill send her to the other estate which was situated forty miles distant and flay you alive into the bargain the poor fellow after thanking the overseer not for his politeness certainly darted off to communicate the joyful intelligence to his affianced making the welkin ring with his shouts the gentleman who described this scene said that it was always the custom on his fathers estate to give a gallon or two of whiskey for the attendant merrymaking after numerous stoppages the train at length reached charleston the journey from greensborough had been a tedious one besides the annoyance of slow travelling through the inefficient state of the line which was so defective that the carriages frequently left the rails the noisome effluvia arising from the swamps we had to pass through which harbour innumerable alligators and other reptiles had the most debilitating effect on the frame which was increased by the extreme sultriness of the weather after leaving my ticket at the terminus i disposed of my baggage by hiring a negro to carry it to my boardinghouse and slowly wended my way into the city a spacious public square at the end of kingstreet through which i had to pass to my table dhote presented an animated view the citizens being assembled to celebrate the anniversary of the independence conferred by washington and his compatriots by the solemn declaration of the th july  long tables under gay awnings to shield the company from the burning rays of the sun which at the time were intense groaned with every luxury the climate afforded but the banquet was not furnished by this alone for cuba and some of the neighbouring islands it was stated had been ransacked for delicacies crowds of elegantlydressed ladies in general of very sallow look and languid air and spiritlike children with swarthylooking men many of whose visages bore evident traces of exposure to the ill effects of the climate and of dissipation crowded the festive board the negro attendants in dozens moved about with automatic order as is characteristic of all the race on such occasions for the negro is a model waiter at a banquet their snowy costumes contrasting strongly with their black visages and the jovial scene around the merry peals of laughter as some unlucky wight upset a dish or scattered the sauce in everybodys face within reach indicated lightness of heart and merriment and conviviality seemed the order of the day the imposing scene before me after a long absence from social meetings in civilized life was very cheering and had it not been for the inertia i felt at the time arising from a fatiguing journey and the tertian ague i should have felt disposed to participate in the days enjoyment other considerations might however have prevented this i was a stranger to all around and knew that i should be either subjected to impertinent interrogations or become the object of invidious remarkthis in my debilitated state of health i felt anxious to avoid as calculated to impede my restoration my joining the assembled party might also have involved the chance of surveillance during my stay which before my departure for europe i intended should be rather protracted i may have been mistaken in this view but from the character i had heard of the place i felt justified in giving way to the suspicion i was beguiled into the erroneous idea that a sense of happiness and security reigned in the assembled multitude a notion quite fallacious from attendant circumstances as i shall directly explain troops were stationed at a guardhouse in the vicinity and the sentinels paced in front of the building as if in preparation for or in expectation of a foe affording a great contrast to the apparent security of the inhabitants assembled in the square before reaching charleston i had been apprised of the state of jeopardy the citizens were in from the possibility of a recurrence of those scenes of anarchy enacted at the insurrection of the slaves some time beforescenes which had filled every heart with dismay and spread ruin and desolation on every side from what i could glean of that fearful drama the slaves in the surrounding districts on a concerted signal from their confederates in charleston made a descent upon the city and rendered furious by long oppression proceeded to fire it and massacre the inhabitants no language can convey an accurate idea of the consternation of the white inhabitants as it was described to me the tocsin was sounded the citizens assembled armed capapie and after much hard fighting the rebellion was crushed and large numbers of the insurgents were slain or arrested then came the bloody hand of what was impiously termed retributive justice a court or sort of drumhead courtmartial not worthy to be called a trial condemned numbers of the slaves to death and they were led out instantly to execution my informant told me that many a brave noblehearted fellow was sacrificed who under happier circumstances though in a cause not half so righteous would have been extolled as a hero and bowed down with honours many a humble hearth was made desolate and in the language quoted by my informant as in the days of the curse that descended on the people of the obdurate pharaoh every house mourned its dead still there was a strong lurking suspicion that the emeute of the negroes had only been temporarily suppressed and awful forebodings of fire and of blood spread a gloom on the minds of all this was the version given to me by a friend of what he described as the most fearful rising amongst the negroes ever before known in the southern states of america as i passed up the long range of tables the health of the president of the republic was responded to by the company the cheers were deafening and what most surprised me was that the negro waiters joined heartily i may say frantically in it and danced about like mad creatures waving their napkins and shouting with energy some of the elder ones i noticed looked mournfully on and were evidently not in a gay humour seeming a prey to bitter reflections notwithstanding the curse of slavery which like a poisonous upas taints the very air they breathe with the murdered remains of its victims the white citizens of the south are extremely sensitive of their civil and political rights and seem to regard the palladium of independence secured by their progenitors as an especial benefit conferred by the deity for their good in particular actuated by this mock patriotism for it is nothing less the citizens of the south omit no opportunity of demonstrating the blessings they so undeservedly inherit and which if i am not mistaken will ere many years elapse be wrested from them amidst the terrible thunders of an oppressed and patient people whose powers of endurance are indeed surprising leaving the square i passed up kingstreet at the top of which was my intended boardinghouse the shops in this fashionable resort are fitted out in good style and the goods are of the best description after sunset the streets are often lined with carriages the city lies flat like the surrounding country and owing to this is insalubrious stagnant water collects in the cellars of the houses and engenders a poisonous vapour which is a fertile source of those destructive epidemics that combined with other causes are annually decimating the white population of the south of the american continent in all parts at the top of kingstreet facing you as you advance is a large protestant episcopal church i went there to worship on the following sunday but was obliged to leave the building there being it was stated by the apparitor no accommodation for strangers a piece of illiberality that i considered very much in keeping with the slaveholding opinions of the worshippers who attend it this want of politeness i was not however surprised at for it is notorious as has been before observed by an able writer that excepting the church of rome the members of the unestablished church of englandthe protestant episcopalian are the most bigotted sectarian and illiberal in the united states of america being fully persuaded to follow the same writer that prelatical ordination and the three orders are indispensable to their profession they are like too many of their fellow professors in the mother country deeply dyed with laudean principles or that love of formula in religion and grasping for power which has so conspicuously shown itself among the oxford tractarians and which it is to be feared is gradually undermining protestant conformity by gnawing at its very heart in the colleges of great britain vital piety or that deep sense of religious duty that impels men to avoid the devious paths of sin and to live near to god is i am inclined to believe and i regret it as a painful truth by no means common in america there are however many pastors who faithfully warn their flocks of the dangers of the world and who strenuously advise their hearers to take warning lest they be overcaptivated with the song of the syrens these however i must say are chiefly in the free states for i cannot regard southern ministers in any other light than pharisaical while they continue openly as is their constant practice to support from their pulpits the institution that is the main stay of the southern states i mean slavery in my intercourse with serious individuals with whom i came in contact during my stay on the continent of america the doctrines of dr pusey and his confederates were often referred to and although i believe the association for restoring the ancient powers of the clergy and the primary rites and usages of the church does not acknowledge the protestant episcopalians in america owing perhaps chiefly to the invidious position the latter stand in with the state and the little chance of their views being universally embraced by them but partially no doubt to the evangelical principles of most of the ministers officiating in that church yet the subject has excited much interest there and the romish propensities of many pastors plainly indicate that inherent love of power that invariably and it may be said necessarily developes itself in hierarchical institutionsa propensity that ought to be closely watched by protestant lay congregations as being not only innovating and dangerous in its tendency but calculated to foster that superstition which is at once the fundamental principle of the faith of the city of the seven hills and the power of that triplecrowned monster popery i afterwards went into a large independent chapel in another part of the town where i was more courteously treated here was a very eloquent and noted preacher a dr groyard from mobile he was delivering a very eloquent harangue interspersed with touches of proslavery sentimentalism and rhetorical flourish the former especially directed to the negroes in the gallery when suddenly a cry of fire fire was raised in the street the learned doctor stood as if electrified and the instant after his hearers rushed pellmell out of the chapel amidst the shrieks of the females and the consternation of the men caused without doubt by a lurking suspicion of impending evil from the negroes which i have before referred to on ascertaining that the alarm was caused by a house being on fire in the vicinity the service was abruptly terminated the following day i continued my perambulations to the left of the episcopal church i have already mentioned and surrounded by umbrageous trees in a parklike enclosure is the townhall i entered this building where i found a bench of magistrates the mayor of the city being amongst them adjudicating on the cases brought before them these consisted chiefly of negroes apprehended in the streets after nine oclock the previous night they were in all cases except where their owners paid the fine sentenced to receive from ten to twenty lashes which were administered at once by the city gaoler in a yard at the rear of a building near which officers were in attendance for the purpose i must mention in explanation that one of the laws passed directly after the insurrection was to prohibit negroes on any pretence to be out after nine pm at that hour the city guard armed with muskets and bayonets patrolled the streets and apprehended every negro male or female they found abroad it was a stirring scene when the drums beat at the guardhouse in the public square i have before described preparatory to the rounds of the soldiers to witness the negroes scouring the streets in all directions to get to their places of abode many of them in great trepidation uttering ejaculations of terror as they ran this was an inexorable law and punishment or fine was sure to follow its dereliction no excuse being available and as the owners seldom submitted to pay the fine the slaves were compelled to take the consequences which in the language that consigned them to the cruel infliction consisted of from ten to twenty lashes well laid on with a rawhide a murderous whip which draws blood after the first few strokes and is as torturing i should imagine as the russian knout certainly proving in many instances as fatal as that odious instrument the crowning severity of the enactments i have referred to remains however to be told so heinous in a negro is the crime of lifting his hand in opposition to a white man in south carolina that the law adjudges that the offending member shall be forfeited this is or was quite as inexorable as the one i have before spoken of and when in charleston i frequently amongst the flocks of negroes passing and repassing saw individuals with one hand only like the administration of miscalled justice on negroes in all slaveholding states in america the process was summary the offender was arrested brought before the bench of sitting magistrates and on the ex partea statement of his accuser condemned to mutilation being at once marched out to the rear of the building and the hand lopped off on a block fixed there for the purpose i noticed a block and axe myself in the yard of a building near the townhall and on looking at them closely saw they were stained almost black with what i have little hesitation in saying was human blood my conductor however tried to divert my attention from the object and knowing i was an englishman refused to enter on the subject footnote a the writer was assured when in charleston that this was the case in five out of every six cases
